# ‚≠ê Marvel Information Portal
Information portal about Marvel characters and comics. 
### From the user's point of view:
**On the Characters tab you can:**
- get a random character, as well as learn more about him by clicking on the 'Homepage' or 'Wiki' links;
- get a list of characters in the form of cards, by clicking on which you can find out more detailed information: links to more detailed information, a short description and a list of comics in which this character is present;
- if you need to get more characters than 9, there is a 'load more' button at the bottom;
- filter characters by name and find the right one, for this there is a field 'find a character by name'.

**On the Comics tab you can:**
